##file navigation ::

* eventPlanner - main gui method, builds the base jframe
* eventListPanel - builds the panel that holds each added event
* eventPanel - creates a panel of the new event

* package LOGIC holds the logic classes
*   the methods in this are pretty straight forward
  
##extra comments
* I hate gui so the code looks gross
* code in LOGIC is less messy and overall better
* need to add verification with formatting the dateTime for my GUI
